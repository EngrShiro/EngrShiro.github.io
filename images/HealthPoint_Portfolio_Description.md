# HealthPoint Pharmacy — Global Performance Dashboard

---

## 1. Project Title
**Pharmacy Global Performance Dashboard | Multi-Dimensional Profit & Market Analytics**

---

## 2. Overview
This multi-page business intelligence dashboard delivers a 360° view of pharmacy performance across Europe, spanning profit trends, regional sales, product mix, and store-level execution. Built for HealthPoint Pharmacy, it transforms raw transactional data into executive-ready insights across three analytical layers: Overview, Pharmacy Performance, and Product Analysis. The dashboard empowers leadership to identify where profit is being made, where it is being lost, and what levers to pull for growth.

## 3. Business Problem
Pharmacy chains operating across multiple countries and store formats face a common challenge: fragmented visibility into what drives profitability. Without a consolidated view, leadership cannot quickly pinpoint which regions, product categories, store types, or brands are underperforming — making it difficult to allocate marketing spend, optimize inventory, or prioritize high-margin growth opportunities. This dashboard directly addresses that gap by unifying performance data into a single, decision-ready platform.

This dashboard reduces the time to insight from days to seconds — enabling pharmacy executives and regional managers to make faster, evidence-backed decisions on pricing, product assortment, and marketing investment.

The self-service design empowers non-technical stakeholders to explore data independently, reducing reliance on ad hoc analyst requests and fostering a data-driven culture across the organization.
